# DataStructureExample
My learning with Data structure 

# Array Based interview question
inside ArrayQuestion package you can find two java class.
 1. ArrayQuestion.java :- Contain all important question based on Array
 2. TestArrayQuestion.java :- Main class to compile and test question

# Singly Linked List (LL)
Generally called as LL consist of a number of nodes in which each nodes has a next pointer to the following elements.
The link of the last node points to NULL which indicates end of list.

# Doubly Linked List(DLL)
    Navigate in both direction
    Each node contains Previous and Next node pointer.
     
# Circular linked list
CLL is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. 
There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or 
doubly circular linked list.

# Interview Question Based on LinkList
Inside LinkedListQuestion package, you guys find all very important interview question based on Linked List.
So Do not miss the chance, go and see the question and solution. Run it verify it. 

# Stacks
A stacks is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end.
The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted/removed.(LIFO)

     Insertion in Stacks = push
	 remove from Stacks = pop
	 pop-out from Empty Stacks = UnderFlow
	 Push-in full stacks = over flow

# Java Collection API Example
I have added Example of Java Collection Interface(<b>List, Set, Queue</b>) and MAP.  You can find all Example under  "com.saurbh.java.collections.example"
-  List interface have <b>ArrayList</b> and <b>LinkedList</b> Class
-  Set interface have <b>HashSet</b> , <b> LinkedHashSet</b> and <b>TreeSet</b> class
-   Queue interface  have <b>ArrayDeque</b> and <b>PriorityQueue</b>class
-  Map interface have <b>TreeMap</b> and <b>HashMap</b> class

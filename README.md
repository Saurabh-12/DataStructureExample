# DataStructureExample
My learning with Data structure 

# Singly Linked List (LL)
Generally called as LL consist of a number of nodes in which each nodes has a next pointer to the following elements.
The link of the last node points to NULL which indicatesend of list.

# Doubly Linked List(DLL)
    Navigate in both direction
    Each node contains Previous and Next node pointer.
     
# Circular linked list
CLL is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. 
There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or 
doubly circular linked list.

# Stacks
A stacks is an ordered list in which insertion and deletion are done at one end.
The last element inserted is the first one to be deleted/removed.(LIFO)
Insertion in Stacks = push
remove from Stacks = pop
pop-out from Empty Stacks = Under Flow
Push-in full stacks = over flow
